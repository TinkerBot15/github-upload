        <h2 class="first">Becoming Meek and Lowly</h2>
        <p class="check">The single sentence which I have selected for my text consists of these words:—"I am meek and lowly in heart." These words might be taken to have three distinct bearings upon the context. They may be regarded as being the lesson to be taught: "Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart." One great lesson of the gospel is to teach us to be meek—to put away our high and angry spirits, and to make us lowly in heart. Peradventure, this is the meaning of the passage— that it we will but come to Christ's school, he will teach us the hardest of all lessons,—how to be meek and lowly in heart. Again; other expositors might consider this sentence to signify, that is the only Spirit in which a man can learn of Jesus,— the Spirit which is necessary if we would become Christ's scholars. We can learn nothing, even of Christ himself, while we hold our heads up with pride, or exalt ourselves with self-confidence. We must be meek and lowly in heart, otherwise we are totally unfit to be taught by Christ. Empty vessels may be filled; but vessels that are full already can receive no more. The man who knows his own emptiness can receive abundance of knowledge, and wisdom, and grace, from Christ; but he who glories in himself is not in a fit condition to receive anything from God. I have no doubt that both of these interpretations are true, and might be borne out by the connection. It is the lesson of Christ's school—it is the spirit of Christ's disciples. But I choose, rather, this morning, to regard these words as being a commendation of the Teacher himself. "Come unto me and learn; for I am meek and lowly in heart." As much as to say, "I can teach, and you will not find it hard to learn of me." In fact, the subject of this morning's discourse is briefly this: the gentle, lovely character of Christ should be a high and powerful inducement to sinners to come to Christ. I intend so to use it: first of all, noticing the two qualities which Christ here claims for himself. He is "meek;" and then he is "lowly in heart;" and after we have observed these two things, I shall come to push the conclusion home. Come unto him, all ye that are labouring and are heavy laden; come unto him, and take his yoke upon you; for he is meek and lowly in heart.<br>
    I. First, then, I am to consider THE FIRST QUALITY WHICH JESUS CHRIST CLAIMS. He declares that he is<em> "MEEK."</em>
    Christ is no egotist; he takes no praise to himself. If ever he utters a word in self-commendation, it is not with that object; it is with another design, namely that he may entice souls to come to him. Here, in order to exhibit this meekness, I shall have to speak of him in several ways.<br>
    <p>   Behold your Saviour, disciples, and see whether he was not meek. He had long preached in Jerusalem without effect, and at last he knew that they were ready to put him to death; but what saith he, as, standing on the top of the hill, he beheld the city that had rejected his gospel? Did he invoke a curse upon it? Did he suffer one word of anger to leap from his burning heart? Ah! no; there were flames, but they were those of love; there were scalding drops, but they were those of grief. He beheld the city, and wept over it, and said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not." And for a further proof of the absence of all uncharitableness, observe that, even when they drove the nails into his blessed hands, yet he had no curse to breathe upon them, but his dying exclamation was, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." O sinners! see what a Christ it is that we bid you serve. No angry bigot, no fierce warrior, claiming your unwilling faith: he is a tender Jesus. Your rejection of him has made his bowels yearn over you; and though you abhor his gospel, he has pleaded for you, saying, "Let him alone yet another year, till I dig about him; peradventure he may yet bring forth fruit." What a patient master is he! Oh! will you not serve him!</p>
        
        
        <h3 id="second">Dying to Self</h3>
        
        <p>Galatians 2:20  is a constant encouragement to me: “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” May we continuously celebrate that Christ lives in us and pray that His life flourishes in us and flows through us to be a blessing to others.

How do we do that? One primary key for me is the principle of dying to self. The word “crucified” is pretty powerful to us as Christians. We immediately think of the One who was crucified for us. While we are not all asked to die physically for Christ (some are martyrs, but not all), we are all asked to live for Christ; and to do that we must die to self. We either live for self or live for Christ. Not both.

What does it mean to die to self? It means we put our carnal nature on the cross. We put our selfish desires on the cross. We put our fleshly leanings on the cross. When Jesus died on the Cross, He gave His life for you and me. For us, dying to self allows us to give and live our lives for Him. Crucifixion speaks about death; Jesus died on the Cross. We need to, in effect, put our old nature on a cross and die to self. What a powerful image — and even more powerful truth.

We die to self so that we can say no to carnal conversations. We die to self so that we can say no to selfish desires. We die to self so we can say no to fleshly temptations. And we say yes to living like Christ, for Christ, and in Christ.

What needs to die in your life? What forms of ungodliness need to be crucified if you will? Where do you need to live for Christ more powerfully, in the power of His Spirit who is in you?

“I no longer live…but Christ lives in me.” Stirring words, to be sure. This is the goal, to die to self so that we can live like never before — for Him. May these words be lived out in and through us for His glory.
